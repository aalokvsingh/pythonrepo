Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language.It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.'

Python is Interpreted means, Python program is processed at runtime by the interpreter.
You do not need to compile your program before executing it.Python is similar to PERL and PHP. So <b>Python is a scripting languages</b> which use Interpreter whereas Programming languages like JAVA, C, C++ are those which use compiler.
